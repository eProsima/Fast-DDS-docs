Fast DDS Suite Image
====================

This Docker image contains the complete Fast DDS suite. This includes:

- :ref:`eProsima Fast DDS libraries and examples <fast_dds_suite_examples>`: Fast DDS libraries bundled with several
  examples that showcase a variety of capabilities of eProsima's Fast DDS implementation.

- :ref:`Shapes Demo <fast_dds_suite_shapes_demo>`: eProsima Shapes Demo is an application in which Publishers and
  Subscribers are shapes of different colors and sizes moving on a board. Each shape refers to its own topic: Square,
  Triangle or Circle. A single instance of the eProsima Shapes Demo can publish on or subscribe to several topics at
  a time.

  You can read more about this application on the `Shapes Demo documentation page <https://eprosima-shapes-demo.readthedocs.io/>`_.

- :ref:`Fast DDS Monitor <fast_dds_suite_monitor>`: eProsima Fast DDS Monitor is a graphical desktop application aimed
  at monitoring DDS environments deployed using the *eProsima Fast DDS* library. Thus, the user can monitor in real
  time the status of publication/subscription communications between DDS entities. They can also choose from a wide
  variety of communication parameters to be measured (latency, throughput, packet loss, etc.), as well as record and
  compute in real time statistical measurements on these parameters (mean, variance, standard deviation, etc.).

  You can read more about this application on the `Fast DDS Monitor documentation page
  <https://fast-dds-monitor.readthedocs.io/>`_.

- :ref:`DDS Router <fast_dds_suite_dds_router>`: eProsima DDS Router is an end-user software application that enables
  the connection of distributed DDS networks.
  That is, DDS entities such as publishers and subscribers deployed in one geographic location and using a dedicated
  local network will be able to communicate with other DDS entities deployed in different geographic areas on their own
  dedicated local networks as if they were all on the same network through the use of eProsima DDS Router.
  This is achieved by deploying a DDS Router on an edge device of each local network so that the DDS Router routes DDS
  traffic from one network to the other through WAN communication.

  You can read more about this application on the
  `DDS Router documentation website <https://eprosima-dds-router.readthedocs.io>`_.

- :ref:`Plotjuggler eProsima Edition <fast_dds_suite_plotjuggler>`: eProsima Fast DDS Visualizer Plugin is a plugin
  for the *PlotJuggler* application.
  PlotJuggler is a graphical desktop application providing visualization features
  of data series, time series, X-Y plots.
  It also adds data management features, such as
  data import and export, custom and built-in data manipulation functions,
  data series merges, etc.
  Also, this software supports many different layouts, with dynamic, rich and user-friendly customization.

  You can read more about this application on the
  `Plotjuggler eProsima Edition documentation website <https://plotjuggler-fastdds-plugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

To load this image into your Docker repository, from a terminal run

.. code-block:: bash

    docker load -i "ubuntu-fastdds-suite <FastDDS-Version>.tar"

You can run this Docker container as follows

.. code-block:: bash

    xhost local:root
    docker run -it --privileged -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    ubuntu-fastdds-suite:<FastDDS-Version>

From the resulting Bash Shell you can run each feature.

.. _fast_dds_suite_examples:

Fast DDS Examples
-----------------

Included in this Docker container is a set of binary examples that showcase several functionalities of the
Fast DDS libraries. These examples' path can be accessed from a terminal by typing

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples

From this folder you can access all examples, both for DDS and RTPS. We detail the steps to launch two such
examples below.

Hello World Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a minimal example that will perform a Publisher/Subscriber match and start sending samples.

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples
    cd dds/HelloWorldExample/bin
    tmux new-session "./DDSHelloWorldExample publisher 0 1000" \; \
        split-window "./DDSHelloWorldExample subscriber" \; \
        select-layout even-vertical

This example is not constrained to the current instance. It's possible to run several instances of this
container to check the communication between them by running the following from each container.

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples
    cd dds/HelloWorldExample/bin
    ./DDSHelloWorldExample publisher

or

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples
    cd dds/HelloWorldExample/bin
    ./DDSHelloWorldExample subscriber

Benchmark Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example creates either a Publisher or a Subscriber and on a successful match starts sending samples. After a
few seconds the process that launched the Publisher will show a report with the number of samples transmitted.

On the subscriber side, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples
    cd dds/Benchmark/bin
    ./DDSBenchmark subscriber udp

On the publisher side, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples
    cd dds/Benchmark/bin
    ./DDSBenchmark publisher udp

.. _fast_dds_suite_shapes_demo:

Shapes Demo
-----------

To launch the Shapes Demo, from a terminal run

.. code-block:: bash

    ShapesDemo

eProsima Shapes Demo usage information can be found on the `Shapes Demo documentation
<https://eprosima-shapes-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first_steps/first_steps.html>`_.

.. _fast_dds_suite_monitor:

Fast DDS Monitor
----------------

To launch the Fast DDS Monitor, from a terminal run

.. code-block:: bash

    fastdds_monitor

eProsima Fast DDS Monitor user manual can be found on the `Fast DDS Monitor documentation
<https://fast-dds-monitor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/user_manual/initialize_monitoring.html>`_.

.. _fast_dds_suite_dds_router:

DDS Router
----------
This example configures a DDS Router to communicate a publisher and subscriber running in different DDS Domains.

Run the following command to create the DDS Router *yaml* configuration file (``/config.yml``).

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "version: v2.0
    participants:
      - name: simple_dds_participant_0
        kind: local
        domain: 0
      - name: simple_dds_participant_1
        kind: local
        domain: 1" > /config.yml

Then execute the following command to run the Publisher in Domain 0, the Subscriber in Domain 1, and the
DDS Router communicating both Domains.

.. code-block:: bash

    goToExamples
    cd dds/BasicConfigurationExample/bin
    tmux new-session \
        "ddsrouter --config-path /config.yml" \; \
        split-window -h "./BasicConfigurationExample publisher --domain 0 --interval 1000 --transport udp" \; \
        split-window -v "./BasicConfigurationExample subscriber --domain 1 --transport udp"

eProsima DDS Router usage information can be found on the `DDS Router documentation
<https://eprosima-dds-router.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/getting_started/project_overview.html>`_.

.. _fast_dds_suite_plotjuggler:

.. code-block:: bash

     plotjuggler

eProsima PlotJuggler eProsima Edition usage information can be located on the `PlotJuggler eProsima Edition User Manual
<https://plotjuggler-fastdds-plugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
