Conditions and Wait-sets
========================

Conditions (in conjunction with wait-sets) provide an alternative mechanism to allow the middleware
to notify communication status changes (including arrival of data) to the application.

This mechanism is wait-based. Its general use pattern is as follows:

* The application indicates which relevant information it wants to get, by means of Condition
  objects (GuardCondition, StatusCondition, or ReadCondition) and attaching them to a wait-set.
* It then waits on that wait-set until the trigger value of one or several Condition objects become
  true.
* It then uses the result of the wait (i.e., the list of Condition objects with
  trigger_value == true) to actually get the information by calling:

  * get_status_changes and then get_<communication_status> on the relevant Entity, when the
    condition is a StatusCondition and the status changes refer to plain communication status.
  * get_status_changes and then get_datareaders on the relevant Subscriber, when the condition is a
    StatusCondition and the status changes refer to DataOnReaders.
  * get_status_changes and then read/take on the relevant DataReader, when the condition is a
    StatusCondition and the status changes refer to DataAvailable.
  * Directly read_w_condition/take_w_condition on the DataReader with the Condition as a parameter,
    when it is a ReadCondition

The first step is usually done in an initialization phase, while the others are put in the
application main loop.

Calling the wait operation on the wait-set will block the calling thread if the trigger value of
all the conditions attached to it are false.
The thread will wake up, and the wait operation will return OK, whenever the trigger value of any
of the attached conditions becomes true.

GuardCondition
--------------
A condition for which the trigger value is completely controlled by the application via its
set_trigger_value operation.

StatusCondition
---------------
A condition that triggers whenever there are changes on the communication statuses of an Entity.

The sensitivity of the StatusCondition to a particular communication status is controlled by the
list of enabled_statuses set on the condition by means of the set_enabled_statuses operation.

ReadCondition
-------------
A condition that triggers whenever the DataReader that created it contains at least a sample with
SampleState, ViewState, and InstanceState matching those of the ReadCondition.

The fact that the trigger value of a ReadCondition is dependent on the presence of samples on the
associated DataReader implies that a single take operation can potentially change the trigger value
of several ReadCondition conditions.
For example, if all samples are taken, any ReadCondition associated with the DataReader that were
triggered before, will see their trigger value changed to false.
Note that this does not guarantee that WaitSet objects that were separately attached to those
conditions will not be woken up.
Once we have trigger_value == true on a condition, it may wake up the attached wait-set.
The condition transitioning to trigger_value == false does not necessarily ‘unwakeup’ the wait-set,
as ‘unwakening’ may not be possible in general.
The consequence is that an application blocked on a wait-set may return from the wait with a list
of conditions, some of which are no longer triggered.
This is unavoidable if multiple threads are concurrently waiting on separate wait-set objects and
taking data associated with the same DataReader entity.

To elaborate further, consider the following example:
A ReadCondition that has a sample_state_mask = {NOT_READ} will have trigger_value == true whenever
a new sample arrives and will transition to false as soon as all the newly-arrived samples are
either read (so their status changes to READ) or taken (so they are no longer managed by the
DataReader).
However, if the same ReadCondition had a sample_state_mask = {READ, NOT_READ}, then the
trigger_value would only become false once all the newly-arrived samples are taken (it is not
sufficient to read them as that would only change the SampleState to READ which overlaps the mask
on the ReadCondition).
