.. _dds_layer_subscriber_dataReaderListener:

DataReaderListener
==================

:ref:`api_pim_datareaderlistener` is an abstract class defining the callbacks
that will be triggered in response to state changes on the :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader`.
By default, all these callbacks are empty and do nothing.
The user should implement a specialization of this class overriding the callbacks
that are needed on the application.
Callbacks that are not overridden will maintain their empty implementation.

:ref:`api_pim_datareaderlistener` defines the following callbacks:

* :cpp:func:`on_data_available<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_data_available>`:
  There is new data available for the application on the :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader`.

* :cpp:func:`on_subscription_matched<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_subscription_matched>`:
  The :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader` has found a
  :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriter` that matches the :ref:`dds_layer_topic_topic` and has
  a common partition and a compatible QoS, or has ceased to be matched with a
  :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriter` that was previously considered to be matched.
  It is also triggered when a matched :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriter` has changed its
  :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriterQos`.

* :cpp:func:`on_requested_deadline_missed<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_requested_deadline_missed>`:
  The :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader` did not receive
  data within the deadline period configured on its :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReaderQos`.
  It will be called for each deadline period and data instance for which the
  :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader` missed data.

* :cpp:func:`on_requested_incompatible_qos<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_requested_incompatible_qos>`:
  The :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader` has found a
  :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriter` that matches the :ref:`dds_layer_topic_topic` and has
  a common partition, but with a QoS that is incompatible with the one defined on the
  :ref:`dds_layer_subscriber_dataReader`.

.. note::
   Currently
   :cpp:func:`on_requested_incompatible_qos<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_requested_incompatible_qos>`
   is not implemented (it will never be called), and will be implemented on a future release of Fast DDS.

* :cpp:func:`on_liveliness_changed<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_liveliness_changed>`:
  The liveliness status of a matched :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriter` has changed.
  Either a :ref:`dds_layer_publisher_dataWriter` that was *inactive* has become *active* or the other
  way around.

* :cpp:func:`on_sample_rejected<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_sample_rejected>`:
  A received data sample was rejected.

* :cpp:func:`on_sample_lost<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DataReaderListener::on_sample_lost>`:
  A data sample was lost and will never be received.
