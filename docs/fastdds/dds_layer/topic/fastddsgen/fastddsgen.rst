Fast DDS-Gen for data types source code generation
--------------------------------------------------

*eProsima Fast DDS* comes with a built-in source code generation tool, *Fast DDS-Gen*, which eases the process of
translating an IDL specification of a data type to a functional implementation.
Thus, this tool automatically generates the source code of a data type defined using IDL.
A basic use of the tool is described below.
To learn about all the features that *Fast DDS* offers, please refer to :ref:`Fast DDS-Gen <fastddsgen_intro>` section.

Basic usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

*Fast DDS* can be executed by calling *fastddsgen* on Linux or *fastddsgen.bat* on Windows.
The IDL file containing the data type definition is given with the :code:`<IDLfile>` argument.

Among the available arguments defined in :ref:`fastddsgen_usage`, the main *Fast DDS-Gen* options for data type source
code generation are the following:

*   :code:`-replace`: It replaces existing files in case the data type files have been previously generated.
*   :code:`-help`: It lists the currently supported platforms and Visual Studio versions.
*   :code:`-no-typeobjectsupport`: It disables the automatic generation of the |TypeObject| registration code.
*   :code:`-example`: It generates a basic example of a DDS application and the files to build it for
    the given :code:`platform`.
    Thus, *Fast DDS-Gen* tool can generate a sample application using the provided data type, together with a
    `Makefile`, to compile it on Linux distributions, and a Visual Studio project for Windows.
    To see an example of this please refer to tutorial :ref:`fastddsgen_pubsub_app`.

Output files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Fast DDS-Gen* outputs several files.
Assuming the IDL file had the name *“Mytype”*, and none of the above options have been defined, these files are:

*   MyType.hpp: Type definition.
*   MyTypePubSubType.cxx/.h: Serialization and deserialization source code for the data type.
    It also defines the |TopicDataType::getKey-api| member function of the :class:`MyTypePubSubType` class in case the
    topic implements keys (see :ref:`dds_layer_topic_keyed_data_types`).
*   MyTypeCdrAux.hpp/.ipp: Auxiliary methods required by Fast CDR for type encoding and decoding.
*   MyTypeTypeObjectSupport.cxx/.hpp: Auxiliary code required for |TypeObject| generation and registration.
