TopicDescription
================

:class:`TopicDescription` is an abstract class that serves as the base for all classes describing a data flow.
Applications will not create instances of :class:`TopicDescription` directly, they must create instances of one
of its specializations instead.
At the moment, the only specialization available is :ref:`dds_layer_topic_topic`.
