TopicListener
=============

|TopicListener-api| is an abstract class defining the callbacks that will be triggered
in response to state changes on the :ref:`dds_layer_topic_topic`.
By default, all these callbacks are empty and do nothing.
The user should implement a specialization of this class overriding the callbacks
that are needed on the application.
Callbacks that are not overridden will maintain their empty implementation.

TopicListener has the following callback:

 * |TopicListener::on_inconsistent_topic-api|: A remote Topic is discovered with the same name
   but different characteristics as another locally created Topic.

.. warning::
   Currently |TopicListener::on_inconsistent_topic-api| is not implemented (it will never be called), and will be
   implemented on a future release of *Fast DDS*.
