Fast DDS, as a Data Distribution Service (`DDS <https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/1.4>`_) implementation, provides discovery
mechanisms that allow for automatically finding and matching |DataWriters| and |DataReaders| across |DomainParticipants|
so they can start sharing data.
This discovery is performed, for all the mechanisms, in two phases.
