Dynamic HelloWorld Examples
===========================

These are complete working examples that make use of dynamic types.
You can explore them to find how this feature connects to the rest of Fast DDS,
and learn how to integrate it in your own application.

DynamicHelloWorldExample
------------------------

This example is located in folder ``examples/C++/DynamicHelloWorldExample``.
It shows the use of DynamicType generation to provide the TopicDataType.
This example is compatible with the classic HelloWorldExample.

As a quick reference, the following piece of code shows how the HelloWorld type is created using DynamicTypes:

.. literalinclude:: /../code/CodeTester.cpp
   :language: c++
   :start-after: //DYNAMIC_HELLO_WORLD_API
   :end-before: //!--
   :dedent: 8


DDSDynamicHelloWorldExample
---------------------------

This example uses the DDS API, and it is located in the ``examples/C++/DDS/DynamicHelloWorldExample`` folder.
It shows a publisher that loads a type from an XML file, and shares it during discovery.
The subscriber discovers the type using :ref:`discovery-time-data-typing`, and registers the
discovered type on the ``on_type_discovery`` listener function.

TypeLookupService
-----------------

This example uses the DDS API, and it is located in the ``examples/C++/DDS/TypeLookupService`` folder.
It's very similar to DDSDynamicHelloWorldExample, but the shared type is complex enough to require the
TypeLookup Service due to the dependency of inner struct types.
Specifically, it uses the ``register_remote_type`` approach with a callback.
