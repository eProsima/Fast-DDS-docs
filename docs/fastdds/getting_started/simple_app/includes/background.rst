Background
^^^^^^^^^^

DDS is a data-centric communications middleware that implements the DCPS model.
This model is based on the development of a publisher, a data generating element; and a subscriber, a
data consuming element.
These entities communicate by means of the topic, an element that binds both DDS entities.
Publishers generate information under a topic and subscribers subscribe to this same topic to receive information.
