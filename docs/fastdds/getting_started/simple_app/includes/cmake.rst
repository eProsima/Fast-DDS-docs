Configure the CMake project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will use the CMake tool to manage the building of the project.
With your preferred text editor, create a new file called CMakeLists.txt and copy and paste the following code snippet.
Save this file in the root directory of your workspace. If you have followed these steps, it should
be `workspace_DDSHelloWorld`.

.. literalinclude:: /../code/Examples/C++/DDSHelloWorld/CMakeLists.txt
    :language: cmake
    :lines: 15-42

In each section we will complete this file to include the specific generated files.
