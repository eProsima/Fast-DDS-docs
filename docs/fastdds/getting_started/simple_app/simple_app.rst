Writing a simple publisher and subscriber application
------------------------------------------------------

This section details how to create an simple Fast DDS application with a publisher and a subscriber

It is also possible to self-generate a similar example to the one implemented in this section by using the
*eProsima Fast DDS-Gen* tool.
This additional approach is explained in :ref:`fastddsgen_pubsub_app`.
