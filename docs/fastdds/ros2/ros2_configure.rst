Configuring *Fast DDS* in ROS 2
===============================

ROS 2 only allows for the configuration of certain middleware QoS
(see `ROS 2 QoS policies <https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings/#qos-policies>`_).
However, *rmw_fastrtps* offers extended configuration capabilities
to take full advantage of the features in *Fast DDS*.
This section describes how to specify this extended configuration.

.. _ros2_configure_publication_mode:

Changing publication mode
-------------------------

*rmw_fastrtps* in ROS 2 uses asynchronous publication by default.
This can be easily changed setting the environment variable ``RMW_FASTRTPS_PUBLICATION_MODE``
to one of the following allowed values:

* **ASYNCHRONOUS**: asynchronous publication mode.
  Setting this mode implies that when the publisher invokes the write operation, the data is copied into a queue,
  a background thread (asynchronous thread) is notified about the addition to the queue,
  and control of the thread is returned to the user before the data is actually sent.
  The background thread is in charge of consuming the queue and sending the data to every matched reader.
* **SYNCHRONOUS**: synchronous publication mode.
  Setting this mode implies that the data is sent directly within the context of the user thread.
  This entails that any blocking call occurring during the write operation would block the user thread,
  thus preventing the application from continuing its operation.
  It is important to note that this mode typically yields higher throughput rates at lower latencies,
  since there is no notification nor context switching between threads.
* **AUTO**: let Fast DDS select the publication mode.
  This implies using the publication mode set in the :ref:`XML file<ros2_configure_xml>`, or otherwise,
  the default value set in Fast DDS (see |PublishModeQosPolicy|).



*rmw_fastrtps* defines two configurable parameters in addition to
`ROS 2 QoS policies <https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings/#qos-policies>`_.
Said parameters, and their default values under ROS 2, are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Parameter
     - Description
     - Default ROS 2 value
   * - |MemoryManagementPolicy|
     - *Fast DDS* preallocates memory for the publisher |br|
       and subscriber histories. When those histories fill |br|
       up, a reallocation occurs to reserve more memory.
     - |PREALLOCATED_WITH_REALLOC_MEMORY_MODE-api|
   * - |PublishModeQosPolicy|
     - User calls to publication method add the messages |br|
       in a queue that is managed in a different thread, |br|
       meaning that the user thread is available right |br|
       after the call to send data.
     - |ASYNCHRONOUS_PUBLISH_MODE-api|


.. _ros2_configure_xml:

XML configuration
-----------------

To use specific *Fast-DDS* features within a ROS 2 application,
XML configuration files can be used to configure a wide set of *QoS*.
Please refer to :ref:`xml_profiles` to see the whole list of configuration options available in *Fast DDS*.

When configuring *rmw_fastrtps* using XML files, there are certain points that have to be taken into account:

* ROS 2 QoS contained in `rmw_qos_profile_t <http://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/rmw/structrmw__qos__profile__t.html>`_
  are always honored, unless set to ``*_SYSTEM_DEFAULT``.
  In that case, XML values, or Fast DDS default values in the absences of XML ones, are applied.
  This means that if any QoS in ``rmw_qos_profile_t`` is set to something other than ``*_SYSTEM_DEFAULT``,
  the corresponding value in the XML is ignored.

* By default, *rmw_fastrtps* overrides the values for |MemoryManagementPolicy| and |PublishModeQosPolicy|.
  This means that the values configured in the XML for these two parameters will be ignored.
  Instead, |PREALLOCATED_WITH_REALLOC_MEMORY_MODE-api| and |ASYNCHRONOUS_PUBLISH_MODE-api|
  are used respectively.

* The override of MemoryManagementPolicy and PublishModeQosPolicy can be avoided
  by setting the environment variable ``RMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML`` to ``1``
  (its default value is ``0``).
  This will make *rmw_fastrtps* use the values defined in the XML for
  MemoryManagementPolicy and PublishModeQosPolicy.
  Bear in mind that setting this environment variable but not setting these policies in the XML
  results in using the default values in *Fast DDS*.
  These are different from the aforementioned *rmw_fastrtps* default values
  (see |MemoryManagementPolicy| and |PublishModeQosPolicy|).

* Setting ``RMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML`` effectively overrides whatever configuration was set
  with ``RMW_FASTRTPS_PUBLICATION_MODE``, setting the publication mode to the value specified in the XML,
  or to the *Fast DDS* default publication mode if none is set in the XML.


The following table summarizes which values are used or ignored according to the configured variables:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - RMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML
     - ``rmw_qos_profile_t``

       and publication mode

XML configuration file location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two possibilities for providing *Fast DDS* with XML configuration files:

* **Recommended**: Setting the location with environment variable ``FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE``
  to contain the path to the XML configuration file (see :ref:`env_vars`).

  ::

      export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=<path_to_xml_file>

* **Alternative**: Placing the XML file in the running application directory
  under the name *DEFAULT_FASTRTPS_PROFILES.xml*.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    export FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=<path_to_xml_file>
    export RMW_FASTRTPS_USE_QOS_FROM_XML=1
    ros2 run <package> <application>


Applying different profiles to different entities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*rmw_fastrtps* allows for the configuration of different entities with different QoS using the same XML file.
For doing so, *rmw_fastrtps* locates profiles in the XML based on topic names.

Creating publishers/subscribers with different profiles
.......................................................

* To configure a publisher, define a ``<data_writer>`` profile
  with attribute ``profile_name=topic_name``, where ``topic_name`` is the name of the topic
  prepended by the node namespace (which defaults to "" if not specified),
  i.e. the node's namespace followed by topic name used to create the publisher.
  Mind that topic names always start with ``/`` (it is added when creating the topic if not present),
  and that namespace and topic name are always separated by one ``/``.
  If such profile is not defined, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load the ``<data_writer>`` profile
  with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.

* To configure a subscriber, define a ``<data_reader>`` profile
  with attribute ``profile_name=topic_name``, where ``topic_name`` is the name of the topic
  prepended by the node namespace (which defaults to "" if not specified),
  i.e. the node's namespace followed by topic name used to create the subscriber.
  Mind that topic names always start with ``/`` (it is added when creating the topic if not present),
  and that namespace and topic name are always separated by one ``/``.
  If such profile is not defined, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load the ``<data_reader>`` profile
  with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.

The following table presents different combinations of node namespaces and user specified topic names,
as well as the resulting topic names and the suitable profile names:

+---------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| User specified topic name | Node namespace  | Final topic name        | Profile name            |
+===========================+=================+=========================+=========================+
| chatter                   | DEFAULT ("")    | /chatter                | /chatter                |
+---------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| chatter                   | test_namespace  | /test_namespace/chatter | /test_namespace/chatter |
+---------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| chatter                   | /test_namespace | /test_namespace/chatter | /test_namespace/chatter |
+---------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| /chatter                  | test_namespace  | /chatter                | /chatter                |
+---------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
| /chatter                  | /test_namespace | /chatter                | /chatter                |
+---------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

.. important::

    Node namespaces are NOT prepended to user specified topic names starting with /,
    a.k.a Fully Qualified Names (FQN).
    For a complete description of topic name remapping please refer to
    `Remapping Names <http://design.ros2.org/articles/static_remapping.html>`_.

Creating services with different profiles
.........................................

ROS 2 services contain a subscriber for receiving requests, and a publisher to reply to them.
*rmw_fastrtps* allows for configuring each of these endpoints separately in the following manner:

* To configure the request subscriber, define a ``<data_reader>`` profile with attribute ``profile_name=topic_name``,
  where ``topic_name`` is the name of the service after mangling.
  For more information on name mangling, please refer to
  `Topic and Service name mapping to DDS <https://design.ros2.org/articles/topic_and_service_names.html>`_.
  If such profile is not defined, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load a ``<data_reader>`` profile
  with attribute ``profile_name="service"``.
  If neither of the previous profiles exist, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load the ``<data_reader>`` profile
  with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.

* To configure the reply publisher, define a ``<data_writer>`` profile with attribute ``profile_name=topic_name``,
  where ``topic_name`` is the name of the service after mangling.
  If such profile is not defined, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load a ``<data_writer>`` profile
  with ``attribute profile_name="service"``.
  If neither of the previous profiles exist, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load the ``<data_writer>`` profile
  with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.


Creating clients with different profiles
........................................

ROS 2 clients contain a publisher to send requests, and a subscription to receive the service's replies.
*rmw_fastrtps* allows for configuring each of these endpoints separately in the following manner:

* To configure the requests publisher, define a ``<data_writer>`` profile with attribute ``profile_name=topic_name``,
  where ``topic_name`` is the name of the service after mangling.
  If such profile is not defined, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load a ``<data_writer>`` profile
  with attribute ``profile_name="client"``.
  If neither of the previous profiles exist, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load the ``<data_writer>`` profile
  with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.

* To configure the reply subscription, define a ``<data_reader>`` profile with ``attribute profile_name=topic_name``,
  where ``topic_name`` is the name of the service after mangling.
  If such profile is not defined, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load a ``<data_reader>`` profile
  with attribute ``profile_name="client"``.
  If neither of the previous profiles exist, *rmw_fastrtps* attempts to load the ``<data_reader>`` profile
  with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.


Creating ROS contexts and nodes
...............................

ROS *context* and *node* entities are mapped to *Fast DDS* Participant entity,
according to the following table:


+--------------+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| ROS entity   | *Fast DDS* entity since *Foxy*       | *Fast DDS* entity in *Eloquent & below*|
+==============+======================================+========================================+
| Context      | Participant                          | *Not DDS direct mapping*               |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Node         | *Not DDS direct mapping*             | Participant                            |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

This means that on *Foxy* and later releases, contexts can be configured using a ``<Participant>`` profile
with attribute ``is_default_profile="true"``.
The same profile will be used in *Eloquent* and below to configure nodes.

For example, a profile for a ROS 2 context on *Foxy* and later releases would be specified as:

+---------------------------------------------------------+
| **XML**                                                 |

| .. literalinclude:: /../code/XMLTester.xml              |
|    :language: xml                                       |
|    :start-after: <!-->CONF_ROS2_EXAMPLE                 |
|    :end-before: <!--><-->                               |
|    :lines: 2-3,5-9                                      |
|    :append: </profiles>                                 |
