Statistics Domain Participant
=============================

In order to start collecting data in one of the statistics topics (:ref:`statistics_topic_names`), the corresponding
statistics DataWriter should be enabled.
In fact, *Fast DDS Statistics module* can be enabled and disabled at runtime.
For this purpose, *Fast DDS Statistics module* exposes an extended DDS |StatisticsDomainParticipant-api| API:

Enable statistics DataWriters
-----------------------------

.. warning::
    This method will be implemented in future releases. For the moment it always returns ``RETCODE_UNSUPPORTED``.

Statistics DataWriters are enabled using the method |enable_statistics_datawriter|.
This method requires as parameters:

* Name of the statistics topic to be enabled (see :ref:`statistics_topic_names` for the statistics topic list).
* DataWriter QoS profile (see :ref:`statistics_datawriter_qos` for the recommended profile).

Disable statistics DataWriters
------------------------------

.. warning::
    This method will be implemented in future releases. For the moment it always returns ``RETCODE_UNSUPPORTED``.

Statistics DataWriters are disabled using the method |disable_statistics_datawriter|.
This method requires as parameter:

* Name of the statistics topic to be disabled (see :ref:`statistics_topic_names` for the statistics topic list).

Obtain pointer to the extended |StatisticsDomainParticipant-api| class
----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. warning::
    This method will be implemented in future releases. For the moment it always returns ``nullptr``.

The |DomainParticipant-api| is created using the |DomainParticipantFactory::create_participant-api| provided by the
|DomainParticipantFactory-api|.
This method returns a pointer to the DDS standard DomainParticipant created.
In order to obtain the pointer to the child |StatisticsDomainParticipant-api| which extends the DDS API, the
``static`` method |statistics_narrow| is provided.
