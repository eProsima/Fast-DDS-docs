Announced Locators
==================

In order for communication to take place, DDS entities need to exchange the list of addresses and ports where
they can be reached.
Apart from the :ref:`default announced locators<default_announced_locators>`, which correspond to addresses
of the interfaces in the host where the application is running, the user can configure
:ref:`additional locators<external_locators>` with addresses and ports on other networks, when routing rules
have been correspondingly set up.
