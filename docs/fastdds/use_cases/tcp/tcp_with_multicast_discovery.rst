TCP Communication with Multicast Discovery
==========================================

The following snippets show how to configure *Fast DDS* |DomainParticipants| to run the
:ref:`PDP discovery<disc_phases>` phase over UDP multicast and communicate application data over a
:ref:`transport_tcp_tcp` transport.
With this approach, applications managing large samples can benefit from transmitting their data over TCP, while
at the same time have the flexibility of automatic discovery.
