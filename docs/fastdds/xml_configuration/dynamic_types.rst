Dynamic Types profiles
----------------------

*Fast DDS* supports the implementation of |DynamicTypes| by defining them through XML files.
Thus the topic data types can be modified without the need to modify the source code of the DDS application.

XML Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The definition of data type profiles in the XML file is done with the :code:`types` tag.
Each :code:`types` element can contain one or more :ref:`Type definitions <Type definition>`.
Defining several types within a :code:`types` element or a single type for each :code:`types` element has the same
result.
Below, an example of a stand-alone types definition via XML is shown.

.. literalinclude:: /../code/XMLTesterSkipValidation.xml
    :language: xml
    :start-after: <!--STAND_ALONE_TYPES_START-->
    :end-before: <!--STAND_ALONE_TYPES_END-->

.. note::

    For more information on the difference between stand-alone and rooted definitions please refer to section
    :ref:`rootedvsstandalone`.

Below, the types supported by *eProsima Fast DDS* are presented.

Member types
""""""""""""

Member types are defined as any type that can belong to a :ref:`Struct<xmldynamictypes_struct>` or a
:ref:`Union <xmldynamictypes_union>`, or be aliased by a :ref:`Alias <xmldynamictypes_typedef>`.
These can be defined by the ``<member>`` XML tag.
A member can be annotated as ``key`` (equivalent of the IDL's ``@key``) by setting the ``key`` attribute to ``"true"``.

Primitive types
"""""""""""""""

Primitive types are built-in types and they should be declared as members of an aggregated type
(:ref:`xmldynamictypes_struct` or :ref:`xmldynamictypes_union`).
Primitive types are declared by attribute :code:`type` and the possible values are listed in the table below.
Please, refer to :ref:`xtypes_supportedtypes_primitive` for more information on primitive types.

Several labels might be defined using several :code:`<caseDiscriminator>` elements.
Each case child must have exclusively one union member defined.

Union members are defined using the :code:`<member>` tag with mandatory attributes :code:`name` and :code:`type`.
Depending on the member type, some other mandatory and/or optional attributes might be necessary or available.
Non-primitive types must define the :code:`type` attribute as :code:`nonBasic` and include the :code:`nonBasicTypeName`
attribute with the name of the member type.
At least one union member must be defined for the union type to be consistent.

Bitfield elements require mandatory attribute :code:`bit_bound` with the number of bits managed by the bitfield (maximum
64 bits).
Optionally, attributes :code:`name` and :code:`type` might be defined.
An anonymous bitfield (attribute :code:`name` not set) is not accessible and serves as padding between named bitfields.

*Fast DDS* application can use types defined in XML configuration files once those files have been loaded into the
|DomainParticipantFactory-api| using |DomainParticipantFactory::load_XML_profiles_file-api|.
Types might be retrieved using |DomainParticipantFactory::get_dynamic_type_builder_from_xml_by_name-api|.
After getting the DynamicType, objects of |DynamicPubSubType-api| class might be instantiated and used to write/read
data.
