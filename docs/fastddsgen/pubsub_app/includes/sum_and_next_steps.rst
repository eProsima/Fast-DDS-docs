Summary and next steps
----------------------

In this tutorial, a publisher/subscriber DDS application using *Fast DDS-Gen* has been built.
The tutorial also describes how to generate IDL files that contain the description of the Topic data type.

To continue developing DDS applications please take a look at the
`eProsima Fast DDS examples on github <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/tree/master/examples>`_
for ideas on how to improve this basic application through different configuration
options, and also for examples of advanced *Fast DDS* features.
