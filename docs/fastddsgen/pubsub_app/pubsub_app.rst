Building a publish/subscribe application
=========================================

*Fast DDS-Gen* can be used to build a fully functional publication/subscription application from an IDL file that
defines the Topic under which messages are published and received.
The application generated allows for the creation of as many publishers and subscribers as
desired, all belonging to the same Domain and communicating using the same Topic.
