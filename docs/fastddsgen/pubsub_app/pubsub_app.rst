Building a publish/subscribe application
-----------------------------------------------

The Fast DDS-Gen tool is used to build a fully functional publication/subscription application from an IDL file that
defines the Topic under which messages are published and received.
The application generated allows the creation of as many publishers and subscribers as
desired, all belonging to the same Domain and communicating using the same Topic.
