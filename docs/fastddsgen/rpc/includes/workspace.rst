.. _fastddsgen_rpc_app_workspace:

Create the application workspaces
---------------------------------

We will create two different application workspaces, one for the basic example (``CalculatorBasic``) and one
for the advanced example (``CalculatorAdvanced``).
The file ``build/Calculator`` in each workspace is the generated *Fast DDS* application.

TODO

For each workspace, execute the following command to create the directory in which
the files generated by *Fast DDS-Gen* will be saved, replacing ``<root_folder_path>`` with the path to the folder where
both workspaces will be created.

.. code:: bash

    cd <root_folder_path>
    mkdir CalculatorBasic && cd CalculatorBasic
    mkdir build

    cd ..
    mkdir CalculatorAdvanced && cd CalculatorAdvanced
    mkdir build
    cd ..
