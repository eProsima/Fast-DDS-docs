Building a RPC Client/Server application
========================================

*Fast DDS-Gen* can be used to generate the source code required to
build a *Remote Procedure Calls* (RPC) Client/Server application from an IDL file.

.. This section provides an overview of the steps required to build a *Fast DDS* RPC application from scratch,
.. following the `RPC over DDS specification <https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-RPC/1.0/PDF>`_, using the *Fast DDS-Gen* tool.
