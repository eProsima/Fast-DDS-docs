Configure the CMake project
---------------------------

We will use the CMake tool to manage the building of the project.
With your preferred text editor, create a new file called ``CMakeLists.txt``
and copy and paste the following code snippet.
Save this file in the root directory of your workspace. If you have followed these steps, it should
be `workspace_CalculatorBasic`.

.. literalinclude:: /../code/Examples/C++/RPCClientServerBasic/CMakeLists.txt
    :language: cmake
    :lines: 15-44

In each section we will complete this file to include the specific generated files.
