Background
----------

As this example is based on the basic calculator example, reading the
:ref:`basic example <fastddsgen_rpc_calculator_basic_app_intro>` is recommended to understand
how the application is structured and how the code is generated.
In this section, we only will discuss in depth the source code
related to the new operations and the main differences with the generated source code of the basic example.
In any case, all the source code required to build the application is also provided here.

Please also check the :ref:`Prerequisites <fastddsgen_rpc_calculator_basic_app_prerequisites>` and
:ref:`Dependencies <fastddsgen_rpc_calculator_basic_app_dependencies>` sections of the basic example
for more information about the requirements and dependencies of the RPC client/server applications.
