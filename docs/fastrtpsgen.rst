Code generation using fastrtpsgen
=================================

*eprosima Fast RTPS* comes with a built-in code generation tool, fastrtpsgen, which eases the process of
translating an IDL specification of a data type to a working implementation of the methods needed to create
topics, used by publishers and subscribers, of that data type.
This tool can be instructed to generate a sample application using this data type, providing a `Makefile` to compile it
on Linux and a Visual Studio project for Windows.

*fastrtpsgen* can be invoked by calling fastrtpsgen on Linux or fastrtpsgen.bat on Windows. ::

    fastrtpsgen [-d <outputdir>] [-example <platform>] [-replace] [-typeobject] <IDLfile> [<IDLfile> ...]

The `-replace` argument is needed to replace the currently existing files in case the files for the IDL have been
generated previously.

When the `-example` argument is added, the tool will generate an automated example and the files to build
it for the platform currently invoked. The `-help` argument provides a list of currently supported Visual Studio
versions and platforms.

When `-typeobject` argument is used, the tool will generate additional files for TypeObject generation and
management.
For more information about TypeObject go to :ref:`dynamic-types`.

Output
------

*fastrtpsgen* outputs the several files. Assuming the IDL file had the name *“Mytype”*, these files are:

* MyType.cxx/.h: Type definition.
* MyTypePublisher.cxx/.h: Definition of the Publisher as well as of a PublisherListener.
  The user must fill the needed methods for his application.
* MyTypeSubscriber.cxx/.h: Definition of the Subscriber as well as of a SubscriberListener.
  The behavior of the subscriber can be altered changing the methods implemented on these files.
* MyTypePubSubType.cxx/.h: Serialization and Deserialization code for the type.
  It also defines the `getKey` method in case the topic uses keys.
* MyTypePubSubMain.cxx: The main file of the example application in case it is generated.
* `Makefile` or Visual Studio project files.

If `-typeobject` was used, `MyType.cxx` is modified to register the TypeObject representation in the TypeObjectFactory,
and these files will be generated too:

* MyTypeTypeObject.cxx/.h: TypeObject representation for `MyType` IDL.
