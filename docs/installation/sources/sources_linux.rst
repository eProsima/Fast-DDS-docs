.. _colcon_installation_linux:

Colcon installation
-------------------

colcon_ is a command line tool based on CMake_ aimed at building sets of software packages.
This section explains how to use it to compile *eProsima Fast DDS* and its dependencies.

#. Install the ROS 2 development tools (colcon_ and vcstool_) by executing the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip3 install -U colcon-common-extensions vcstool

   .. note::

       If this fails due to an Environment Error, add the :code:`--user` flag to the :code:`pip3` installation command.

#. Create a :code:`Fast-DDS` directory and download the repos file that will be used to install
   *eProsima Fast DDS* and its dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir ~/Fast-DDS
       cd ~/Fast-DDS
       wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/master/fastrtps.repos
       mkdir src
       vcs import src < fastrtps.repos

#. Build the packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

       colcon build

.. note::

    Being based on CMake_, it is possible to pass the CMake configuration options to the :code:`colcon build`
    command. For more information on the specific syntax, please refer to the
    `CMake specific arguments <https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html#cmake-specific-arguments>`_
    page of the colcon_ manual.

.. _run_app_colcon_sl:

Run an application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running an instance of an application using *eProsima Fast DDS*, the colcon overlay built in the
dedicated :code:`Fast-DDS` directory must be sourced.
There are two possibilities:

* Every time a new shell is opened, prepare the environment locally by typing the
  command:

  .. code-block:: bash

      source ~/Fast-DDS/install/setup.bash

* Add the sourcing of the colcon overlay permanently to the :code:`PATH`, by typing the following:

  .. code-block:: bash

      echo 'source ~/Fast-DDS/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc


.. _cmake_installation_linux:

CMake installation
------------------

This section explains how to compile *eProsima Fast DDS* with CMake_, either :ref:`locally <local_installation_sl>` or
:ref:`globally <global_installation_sl>`.

.. _local_installation_sl:

Local installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a :code:`Fast-DDS` directory where to download and build *eProsima Fast DDS* and its dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

       mkdir ~/Fast-DDS

#. Clone the following dependencies and compile them using CMake_.

   * `Foonathan memory <https://github.com/foonathan/memory>`_

     .. code-block:: bash

         cd ~/Fast-DDS
         git clone https://github.com/eProsima/foonathan_memory_vendor.git
         mkdir foonathan_memory_vendor/build
         cd foonathan_memory_vendor/build
         cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Fast-DDS/install -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
         sudo cmake --build . --target install

   * `Fast CDR <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR.git>`_

     .. code-block:: bash

         cd ~/Fast-DDS
         git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR.git
         mkdir Fast-CDR/build
         cd Fast-CDR/build
         cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Fast-DDS/install
         sudo cmake --build . --target install

#. Once all dependencies are installed, install *eProsima Fast DDS*:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd ~/Fast-DDS
       git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS.git
       mkdir Fast-DDS/build
       cd Fast-DDS/build
       cmake ..  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Fast-DDS/install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Fast-DDS/install
       sudo cmake --build . --target install

.. note::

    By default, *eProsima Fast DDS* does not compile tests.
    However, they can be activated by downloading and installing `Gtest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_.


.. _global_installation_sl:

Global installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install *eProsima Fast DDS* system-wide instead of locally, remove all the flags that
appear in the configuration steps of :code:`Fast-CDR` and :code:`Fast-DDS`, and change the first in the
configuration step of :code:`foonathan_memory_vendor` to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON


.. _run_app_cmake_sl:

Run an application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running an instance of an application using *eProsima Fast DDS*, it must be linked with the library where the
packages have been installed, which in the case of system-wide installation  is: :code:`/usr/local/lib/` (if local
installation is used, adjust for the correct directory).
There are two possibilities:

* Prepare the environment locally by typing the command:

  .. code-block:: bash

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/

* Add it permanently it to the :code:`PATH`, by typing:

  .. code-block:: bash

      echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/' >> ~/.bashrc


.. _fastddsgen_sl:
