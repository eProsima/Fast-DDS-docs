Version 1.3.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release included the following:

* New examples that illustrate how to tweak Fast RTPS towards different applications.
* Improved support for embedded Linux.
* Bug fixing.

Version 1.3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release introduced several new features:

* Unbound Arrays support: Now you can send variable size data arrays.
* Extended Fragmentation Configuration: It allows you to setup a Message/Fragment max size different to the standard
  64Kb limit.
* Improved logging system: Get even more introspection about the status of your communications system.
* Static Discovery: Use XML to map your network and keep discovery traffic to a minimum.
* Stability and performance improvements: A new iteration of our built-in performance tests will make benchmarking
  easier for you.
* ReadTheDocs Support: We improved our documentation format and now our installation and user manuals are available
  online on ReadTheDocs.

Version 1.2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release introduced two important new features:

* Flow Controllers: A mechanism to control how you use the available bandwidth avoiding data bursts.
  The controllers allow you to specify the maximum amount of data to be sent in a specific period of time.
  This is very useful when you are sending large messages requiring fragmentation.
* Discovery Listeners: Now the user can subscribe to the discovery information to know the entities present in the
  network (Topics, Publishers & Subscribers) dynamically without prior knowledge of the system.
  This enables the creation of generic tools to inspect your system.

But there is more:

* Full ROS2 Support: Fast RTPS is used by ROS2, the upcoming release of the Robot Operating System (ROS).
* Better documentation: More content and examples.
* Improved performance.
* Bug fixing.
