Version 2.3.0
=============

This minor release is API compatible with the previous minor release, but introduces **ABI breaks** on
two of the three public APIs:

* Methods and attributes have been added on several classes of the DDS-PIM high-level API, so indexes of
  symbols on dynamic libraries may have changed.

* Methods and attributes have been added on several classes of the RTPS low-level API, so indexes of
  symbols on dynamic libraries may have changed.

* Old Fast-RTPS high-level API remains ABI compatible.

This release adds the following **features**:

* :ref:`Unique network flows <use-case-unique-flows>`
* :ref:`Discovery super-client <ros2-discovery-server-introspection>`
* :ref:`Statistics module API <statistics>`
* :ref:`New flow controller API <api_pim_publishmodeqospolicy>`
* :ref:`Static discovery configuration from raw string <static_xml_load>`
* :ref:`Added reception timestamp to SampleInfo <api_pim_sampleinfo>`
* :ref:`Exposing get_unread_count on DataReader <api_pim_datareader>`

It also includes the following **improvements**:

* Data-sharing delivery internal refactor
* Additional metadata on persistence databases
* Refactor on ReturnCode_t to make it switch friendly
* Performance tests refactored to use DDS-PIM high-level API
* Receive const pointers on delete_xxx methods
* Discovery server improvements
* Made SOVERSION follow major.minor

Some important **bugfixes** are also included:

* Fixed shared memory usage on QNX
* Fixed reference counting on internal pools
* Fixed singleton destruction order
* Fixed interoperability issues with x-types information
* Fixed recovery of shared memory buffers
* Lifespan support in persistent writers

.. note::
  If you are upgrading from a version older than 1.7.0, it is **required** to regenerate generated source from IDL
  files using *fastddsgen*.
  If you are upgrading from any older version, regenerating the code is *highly recommended*.
