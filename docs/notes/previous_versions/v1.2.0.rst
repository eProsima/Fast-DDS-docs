Version 1.2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release introduced two important new features:

* Flow Controllers: A mechanism to control how you use the available bandwidth avoiding data bursts.
  The controllers allow you to specify the maximum amount of data to be sent in a specific period of time.
  This is very useful when you are sending large messages requiring fragmentation.
* Discovery Listeners: Now the user can subscribe to the discovery information to know the entities present in the
  network (Topics, Publishers & Subscribers) dynamically without prior knowledge of the system.
  This enables the creation of generic tools to inspect your system.

But there is more:

* Full ROS2 Support: Fast RTPS is used by ROS2, the upcoming release of the Robot Operating System (ROS).
* Better documentation: More content and examples.
* Improved performance.
* Bug fixing.
