Version 1.8.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release adds the following **feature**:

* XML profiles for `requester` and `replier`

It also has the following **important bug fixes**:

* Solved an issue when recreating a publishing participant with the same GUID (either on purpose or by chance)
* Solved an issue where a publisher could block on `write` for a long time when, after a large number of samples
  have been sent, a new subscriber is matched.

**Note:** If you are upgrading from a version older than 1.7.0, it is **required** to regenerate generated source
from IDL files using *fastrtpsgen*
