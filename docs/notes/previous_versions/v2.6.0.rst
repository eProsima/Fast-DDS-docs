Version 2.6.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This minor release is API compatible with the previous minor release, but introduces **ABI breaks** on two of the three
public APIs:

* Methods and attributes have been added on several classes of the DDS-PIM high-level API, so indexes of symbols on
  dynamic libraries may have changed. Some API is also being deprecated.
* Methods and attributes have been added on several classes of the RTPS low-level API, so indexes of symbols on dynamic
  libraries may have changed.
* Old Fast-RTPS high-level API remains ABI compatible.

This minor release includes the following **features**:

1. :ref:`Allow modifying remote server locators at runtime <DS_modify_server_list>`
2. :ref:`Add statistics physical information to DATA[p] using properties <property_policies_physical_data>`
3. :ref:`Content filter discovery information RTPS API <contentfilterlimits>`
4. Endpoint discovery RTPS API
5. ``on_sample_lost`` RTPS API
6. Transport layer API extension
7. :ref:`XML support for Fast DDS CLI <cli_discovery_run>`
8. :ref:`New exchange format to reduce bandwidth in Static Discovery <property_policies_edp_exchange_format>`

1. Support lowercase keywords on SQL filter
2. Separate initialization and enabling of BuiltinProtocols
3. Add ``disable_positive_acks`` to Static Discovery XML
4. Several updates in the DDS-PIM API
5. Support for octet vectors on XML parser
6. Update README and roadmap
7. Update Fast-CDR submodule to v1.0.24
8. Add new CMake option ``APPEND_PROJECT_NAME_TO_INCLUDEDIR``

Some **bugfixes** are also included:
