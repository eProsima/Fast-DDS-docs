Version 2.9.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This minor release includes several new features (new log macros to avoid conflicts with external libraries), behavior
change (default memory management policy is no longer
:cpp:enumerator:`PREALLOCATED_MEMORY_MODE<eprosima::fastrtps::rtps::MemoryManagementPolicy::PREALLOCATED_MEMORY_MODE>`,
enable by default Fast DDS Statistics module but only taking statistics metrics if the corresponding Statistics
DataWriter is enabled), performance improvements, CI improvements (including address sanitizer jobs), and several bug
fixes.

.. note::
    Mind that, even though this release is API compatible with previous v2.x versions, it is *NOT* ABI compatible with
    previous versions.
    This means that applications upgrading Fast DDS to v2.9.0 will require recompilation, though not source code
    modification.

.. note::
    It is also advisable to regenerate the type support from the IDL files using
    `Fast DDS-Gen v2.3.0 <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-Gen/releases/tag/v2.3.0>`_.
    Furthermore, if upgrading to v2.9.0, it is also recommended to upgrade Fast CDR to
    `v1.0.26 <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR/releases/tag/v1.0.26>`_.

This release includes the following **features**:

1. New log macros :c:macro:`EPROSIMA_LOG_INFO <EPROSIMA_LOG_INFO>`,
   :c:macro:`EPROSIMA_LOG_WARNING <EPROSIMA_LOG_WARNING>` and :c:macro:`EPROSIMA_LOG_ERROR <EPROSIMA_LOG_ERROR>`.
2. Add ``ENABLE_OLD_LOG_MACROS`` CMake option to support
   :ref:`disabling the compilation of previous log macros <old_log_macros_disable>`.

This release includes the following **behavior changes**:

1. Default :ref:`memory management policy <memorymanagementpolicy>` set to
   :cpp:enumerator:`PREALLOCATED_WITH_REALLOC_MEMORY_MODE<eprosima::fastrtps::rtps::MemoryManagementPolicy::PREALLOCATED_WITH_REALLOC_MEMORY_MODE>`.
2. Statistics metrics are only calculated/accumulated when their corresponding DataWriter is enabled in
   :ref:`Fast DDS Statistics Module <statistics_enable_datawriters>`.
3. Enable ``FASTDDS_STATISTICS`` :ref:`CMake option <cmake_options>` by default.

This release includes the following **improvements**:

1. CI improvements:
    1. Add address sanitizer job for Fast DDS library.
    2. Add address sanitizer job for Discovery Server test suite.
2. Upgrade Fast CDR submodule.

This release includes the following **bugfixes**:

1. Synchronization fixes:
    1. Fix deadlock when removing remote DomainParticipants by expired liveliness when using Security.
    2. Protect :cpp:func:`DomainParticipant::set_listener()<eprosima::fastdds::dds::DomainParticipant::set_listener>`
       avoiding null reference.
    3. Fix data race on ``WriterProxy::stop`` while TimedEvent is being triggered.
    4. Protect creation/destruction of Boost's ``named_mutex``.
2. CI fixes:
    1. Fix Statistics Module test suite.
    2. Fix recurring data races in test suite.
    3. Fix thread sanitizer job keeping Ubuntu 20.04.
3. Other:
    1. Fix Topic creation when registering a type name different from the internal TypeSupport name.
    2. Fix communication with asymmetric :ref:`discovery_ignore_flags`.
    3. Several dependencies fixes upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04.
    4. Disable error logged when DomainParticipant profile is not found.
    5. Fix CMake for Fast DDS use as submodule.
    6. Upgrade internal type supports generated with Fast DDS-Gen v2.3.0.
    7. Other minor fixes.

.. note::
  If you are upgrading from a version older than 1.7.0, it is **required** to regenerate generated source from IDL
  files using *fastddsgen*.
  If you are upgrading from any older version, regenerating the code is *highly recommended*.
