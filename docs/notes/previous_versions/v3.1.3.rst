.. important::

    When upgrading to version 3.1.3 it is **highly recommended** to regenerate generated source from IDL files
    using at least `Fast DDS-Gen v4.0.3 <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-Gen/releases/tag/v4.0.3>`_.
    But it is advisable to regenerate them using the latest patch version of ``Fast DDS-Gen v4.0.x``.
